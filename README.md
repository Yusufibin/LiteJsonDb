## :eyes: Overview

Hey there! Welcome to **LiteJsonDb**, your friendly, lightweight JSON-based database. Inspired by the simplicity and real-time capabilities of Firestore, LiteJsonDb makes managing your data a breeze. It's packed with features like encryption, backups, and solid error handling‚Äîall without the heavy lifting.

## :thinking: Why LiteJsonDb?

Let's face it: sometimes you don't need a complex database setup. Maybe you're building a small project, a quick prototype, or you just want a straightforward way to store and retrieve JSON data. LiteJsonDb is here for those moments. It's simple, efficient, and gets the job done without any fuss.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Features

- **Easy Data Management**: Add, edit, retrieve, and delete data with just a few lines of code.
- **Data Encryption**: Keep your data secure with optional encryption (base64 or AES).
- **Backup and Restore**: Automatic backups to keep your data safe. Backup to Telegram.
- **Subcollections**: Organize your data in neat, nested structures.
- **Friendly Error Handling**: Helpful, colorful error messages to guide you.
- **Data Search**: Search for specific values within your database.
- **CSV Export**: Export your data to CSV format.

> [!NOTE]
> LiteJsonDb makes managing JSON data simple and enjoyable. Whether you're building a small app or just need a lightweight data storage solution, LiteJsonDb has you covered. Enjoy! 

## :man_technologist: Installation

Getting started is super easy. Just install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install litejsondb
```

To upgrade to a newer version, use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade litejsondb
```

## :crystal_ball: Usage

### :white_check_mark: Initial Setup

First, import the `JsonDB` class and initialize your database:

```python
import LiteJsonDb

# Initialize with base64 encryption (default)
db = LiteJsonDb.JsonDB()  

# Initialize with AES encryption (requires a key)
db = LiteJsonDb.JsonDB(encryption_method="aes", encryption_key="your_secret_key")

# Initialize without encryption
db = LiteJsonDb.JsonDB(encryption_method="none")

# Migrate data to a new encryption method (e.g., from base64 to AES)
# db.migrate_data(new_encryption_method="aes", new_encryption_key="your_new_secret_key")
```

### ü§ó Basic Operations

#### :heavy_plus_sign: Setting Data

```python
# Set data without extra data
db.set_data("posts")

# Set data with extra data
db.set_data("users/1", {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20})
db.set_data("users/2", {"name": "Coder", "age": 25})
```

#### :writing_hand: Editing Data

```python
# Edit data
db.edit_data("users/1", {"name": "Alex"})
```

#### :ballot_box_with_check: Getting Data

```python
# Get data
print(db.get_data("users/1"))  # Output: {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 20}
print(db.get_data("users/2"))  # Output: {'name': 'Coder', 'age': 25}

# Access specific data using paths
print(db.get_data("users/1/name"))  # Output: Alex
```

#### :wastebasket: Removing Data

```python
# Remove data
db.remove_data("users/2")
```

#### :package: Full Database Retrieval

```python
# Get the full database (readable format)
print(db.get_db(raw=True))

# Get the full database (encrypted/raw format depending on initialization)
print(db.get_db())
```

## üîç Search Data

This feature allows efficient searching for values within the database.

```python
# Basic search (anywhere in the database)
results = db.search_data("Aliou")
print("Basic Search Results:", results)

# Key-specific search
results = db.search_data("Aliou", key="users")
print("Key-specific Search Results:", results)
```

## üì¶ Backup to Telegram

Securely back up your database to a Telegram chat.

```python
# Replace with your bot token and chat ID
db.backup_to_telegram("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN", "YOUR_CHAT_ID") 
```

See the "Backup to Telegram (new)" section above for how to obtain your token and chat ID.

## üì¶ Export to CSV

Export data to CSV format for easy sharing and analysis.

```python
# Export a specific collection
db.export_to_csv("users") 

# Export the entire database
db.export_to_csv()
```

## üêõ Error Handling

LiteJsonDb provides helpful error messages for various scenarios (key exists, key not found, file issues).

### :file_folder: Working with Subcollections

#### :heavy_plus_sign: Setting Subcollection Data

```python
db.set_subcollection("groups", "1", {"name": "Admins"})
```

#### :writing_hand: Editing Subcollection Data

```python
db.edit_subcollection("groups", "1", {"description": "Admin group"})
```

#### :ballot_box_with_check: Getting Subcollection Data

```python
print(db.get_subcollection("groups"))       # Entire subcollection
print(db.get_subcollection("groups", "1"))  # Specific item
```

#### :wastebasket: Removing Subcollection Data

```python
db.remove_subcollection("groups", "1")     # Specific item
db.remove_subcollection("groups")          # Entire subcollection
```

## :memo: Understanding `set_data` vs. Subcollections

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### `set_data`

The `set_data` method is used to add or update data at a specific path. If the key already exists, you will need to use `edit_data` to modify it. This method is great for simple key-value pairs or straightforward data structures.

<pre>
# Set data
db.set_data("users/1", {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20})
</pre>

### Subcollections

Subcollections, on the other hand, are used to create and manage nested structures within your database. They allow you to group related data under a parent key, providing a more organized way to handle complex relationships. Subcollections are essentially collections within collections.

<pre>
# Set subcollection data
db.set_subcollection("groups", "1", {"name": "Admins"})
</pre>

### Key Differences

- **Structure**: `set_data` is used for flat data structures, while subcollections allow for hierarchical organization.
- **Usage**: Use `set_data` for simple key-value pairs and `set_subcollection` when you need nested collections.
- **Organization**: Subcollections help in maintaining a clear structure and grouping related data together, making it easier to manage and query complex relationships.

By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate method for your data management needs, ensuring a well-organized and efficient database.
